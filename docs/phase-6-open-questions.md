## Resolved @ 6.1

| ID | Topic | Outcome |
|----|--------|---------|
| **A1** | Notification provider | Resend + `providers/notifications/` abstraction |
| **A2** | Event fields on Post | Structured schema extension (not frontmatter-only) |
| **A3** | `features.admin` | Explicit boolean; default `true` when auth on; requires auth when on |
| **A4** | Submissions inbox in MVP | Yes — list API + admin UI + email |
| **A5** | Phase 7 first client | Terrible Gerald's (`terrible-geralds`, `food-truck`) |
| **P4-7** | Intake email | Implement in Phase 6 (6.4); P6-2/P6-5/P6-7 for failure, from-address, missing recipient |
| **P6-4** | Public GET draft leakage | Audited @ 6.2 — service + controllers published-only; `status` query ignored |

## Open during Phase 6 build

| ID | Topic | Notes |
|----|--------|--------|
| **P6-2** | `NOTIFICATION_STRICT` | Log-and-succeed vs fail submission on email error — default log+succeed; lock @ **6.4** |
| **P6-3** | Markdown renderer | `marked` vs `react-markdown` — prefer smallest bundle with safe defaults @ **6.7** |
| **P6-5** | Resend `from` address | Verified sending domain vs env `NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL` — lock @ **6.4** |
| **P6-6** | Event datetime timezone | Store `eventStart`/`eventEnd` as UTC ISO vs interpret in `siteConfig.locale.timezone` — lock @ **6.3** |
| **P6-7** | Missing `contact.email` | When intake + notifications on but no recipient — skip send + log vs doctor-only block — lock @ **6.4** / **6.12** |

---

## Carried to Phase 7 (first client)

| ID | Topic |
|----|--------|
| **P4-4** | Catalog ↔ checkout |
| **P7-1** | Pick list doesn't offer what client wants (visual workflow) |

---

## Phase 6 scope reminders

- **Platform work only** — no Terrible Gerald's custom frontend in this phase (that's Phase 7 Type C).
- **Sixth feature pack** `admin` — toggle-mounted; zero surface when off.
- **Tag target** `v0.7.0` at phase close.

## Resolved — do not re-litigate

- Phase plan renumber: 6 operator → 7 first client → 8 multi-tenant — `amendments/phase-plan-amendment-v1.md`
- Opinionated brand per vertical — Phase 5.1
- Dual payment provider per site — rejected @ v0.4.0
- Structured Post event fields vs frontmatter — structured @ 6.1
- Intake form definition editor — defer; seed-only @ 6.1
- WYSIWYG admin — Markdown textarea MVP @ 6.1
